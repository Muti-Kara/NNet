# Simple neural network library
This is a simple computer vision library for cs102 project.<br />
This library spesifically designed for image classification. (Character recognition)<br />
For training ANN part it uses backpropagation.<br />
For training CNN part it uses a simple genetic algorithm.<br />
In order to train network you must first train CNN part, and then use transfer learning to train ANN part.<br />
Main class includes an example usage of pretrained network. (Although it isn't working well)<br />
It's under development.<br />
