# Simple neural network library
This is a simple library for cs102 project. It's under development.<br />
So far I could manage to make my AI differentiate a, b, and t letters.<br />
There are some kernels that can be used.(Too lazy to implement backpropagation)<br />
It has design flaws in implementation of merging convolutional layers to fully connected layers.<br />
