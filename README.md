This is a neural network library for my cs102 project. It will be used for image recognition (character recognition). <br />
This network consists of two part: <br />
1- Convolutional Layers. These layers will be trained with genetic algorithm. <br />
2- Fully Connected Layers. These layers will be trained with backpropagation algorithm. <br />
